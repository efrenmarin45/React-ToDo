# Things To Do

## Overview

Built using React, Apollo, GraphQL and Hasura this To Do application was built to help me understand API's and Databases more. Using Hasura, I created an API with some dummy data. From there, using GraphQL I was able to test out my connection using Postman. In order to help bridge Hasura to React I used Apollo's client and tested again. Finally, once the logic was done and after a lot of google searches, I focused on styling it with CSS and hosted it on Firebase. 

Give it a try!
